# Hartmann's dotfiles

Most of the things have been ported to other repositories. 

- For documentation on system setup see [computer.mads-hartmann.com](https://github.com/mads-hartmann/computer.mads-hartmann.com)
- For actual dotfiles [mads-hartmann/dotfiles](https://github.com/mads-hartmann/dotfiles)

Keeping `literate` around for a bit still until I move the rest over.
