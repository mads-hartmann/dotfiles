I have a /thing/ for automation, I *love* writing documentation, and I
have a weakness for fiddling with the configuration of any program
that I use â€” This merges all three into an executable description of
my computer that can be /weaved/ into what you're reading now or
/tangled/ into a set of files that define the configuration of my
computer.

I'm still in the process of porting over my old dotfiles into this
literate programming approach so you won't find everything here just
yet. Poke around if you're curious.
