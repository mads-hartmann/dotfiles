** Defaults

You can set quite a few things though macOSs user defaults system.
I've mostly taken these from various places online, but most notably
from [[https://mths.be/macos][here]].

Close any open System Preferences panes, to prevent them from
overriding settings weâ€™re about to change

#+CAPTION: ~installers/macos-defaults.sh~
#+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../../.installers/macos-defaults.sh
osascript -e 'tell application "System Preferences" to quit'
#+END_SRC

Ask for the administrator password upfront

#+CAPTION: ~installers/macos.sh~
#+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../../.installers/macos-defaults.sh
sudo -v
#+END_SRC

Keep-alive: update existing `sudo` time stamp until `.macos` has
finished

#+CAPTION: ~installers/macos.sh~
#+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../../.installers/macos-defaults.sh
while true; do sudo -n true; sleep 60; kill -0 "$$" || exit; done 2>/dev/null &
#+END_SRC

** Keybindings

#+CAPTION: ~~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict~
#+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../../.home/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
{
    "~d" = "deleteWordForward:";
    "^w" = "deleteWordBackward:";
    "~f" = "moveWordForward:";
    "~b" = "moveWordBackward:";
}
#+END_SRC
