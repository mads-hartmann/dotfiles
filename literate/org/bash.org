#+TITLE: Bash
#+SETUPFILE: ../etc/options.org

I use bash for scripting not as my shell.

But when I do I still want completions enabled.

#+CAPTION: Source listing for ~.bashrc~.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ../stow/bash/.bashrc
  [ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion ] && . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion
#+END_SRC
