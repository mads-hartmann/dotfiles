#+TITLE: Cheat
#+SETUPFILE: ../../etc/options.org

[[https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat][Cheat]] is an awesome little program that allows you to create and view
interactive cheatsheets on the command-line.

It comes with a bunch of built-in cheatsheets but I use it mostly to
write my own as a simple form for notes.

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install cheat
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

I like syntax highlighting.

#+CAPTION: ~.zsh/plugins/config-cheat.plugin.zsh~
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ../../../.home/.zsh/plugins/config-cheat/config-cheat.plugin.zsh
export CHEATCOLORS=true
#+END_SRC
