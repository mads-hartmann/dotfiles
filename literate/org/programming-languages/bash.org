#+TITLE: Bash
#+SETUPFILE: ../../etc/options.org

I use bash for scripting and not as my [[http://computer.localhost/shell/][shell]] so
my configuraiton is very basis.

There are things that will complain if you don't have a ~~./bash_profile~ so
I usually add one just in case.

#+CAPTION: ~~.bash_profile~.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ../../../.home/.bash_profile
test -f $HOME/.bashrc && source $HOME/.bashrc
#+END_SRC

In case I do end up using it as my shell for a little bit I want code
completions though ðŸ˜‰

#+CAPTION: ~.bashrc~.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ../../../.home/.bashrc
[ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion ] && . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion
#+END_SRC
