[[https://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] is a way to maintain consistent coding styles between
different editors and IDEs.

Usually you'd have a ~.editorconfig~ file in the root of your project,
but I don't always bother with my own personal projects so I have this
file to fall back on.

# Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
